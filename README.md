# LHFiD
This repository contains the source codes for a many-objective evolutionary algorithm (MaOEA), namely LHFiD, its variant LHFiD-i, and some competitor MaOEAs. A manuscript based on LHFiD (and LHFiD-i) has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation, and is under review. The preprint of the manuscript has been uploaded as “COIN Report 2021020”, and can be accessed through https://www.egr.msu.edu/ kdeb/papers/c2021020.pdf.
